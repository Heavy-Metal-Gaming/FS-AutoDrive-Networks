-- Many fixes to broken routes, and edits to be compatible with the tractor/trailer equipment provided with the map mods.  

# Route Map Image
![Route Map](Map.png)

# Route Type Preference
Route map was built in single player using "New Farmer".  
Most of the map is implemented with 2-way routes as the road system is pretty narrow, and dual 1-ways were going to be a problem.  Where room allowed, I created side rail cutouts for vehicles to pass.  
All fields are served with a 1-way spur, to keep vehicles from running head-on into each other.  Same for all sell points.  
The water-logged but traversable paths through the bay are mapped as well.

# Named Destinations

## Fields Served
All fields are served with a 1-way spar.  Turnarounds are as close as possible in all cases.  
Special Note: Field 05 has a very tight turnaround. For my play-through, I will remove some of the field, but I left it alone for this version.

## Non-Standard Structures
So, there is a delivery barge for the mentioned "Boat Unload" sell point.  I did create a route for it, it sort of works - but AD does a very poor job steering the boat, so it's going to get stuck.  Also, fair warning, the barge does  not start with a full tank of gas, and it burns through around a half tank to get there and back.  But, these 3 points are on a single line.
